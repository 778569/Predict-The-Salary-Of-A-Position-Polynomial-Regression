* Import the position_salaries.csv file given
* Your input column is indicated as “Level” and output column is indicated as “Salary”
* Do not split the dataset into train-test or train-validation-test. Use entire dataset for training the regression models
* Train a simple linear regression model and compute the R2 Score of the trained model
* Train three polynomial regression model with degree of 2, 3 and 4 and compute their R2 Scores <br><br>
